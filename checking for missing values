I have created this SQL query to check for missing values in the film table:
SELECT *
FROM film
WHERE film_id IS NULL OR
	title IS NULL OR
	description IS NULL OR
	release_year IS NULL OR
	language_id IS NULL OR
	rental_duration IS NULL OR
	rental_rate IS NULL OR
	length IS NULL OR
	replacement_cost IS NULL OR
	rating IS NULL OR
	last_update IS NULL OR
	special_features IS NULL OR
	fulltext IS NULL;
