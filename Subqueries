Here is an example of a SQL query containing a subquery:

SELECT ROUND( AVG (average.total_amount_paid), 2) AS average_amount_paid
FROM (
SELECT A.customer_id,
	A.first_name, 
	A.last_name,
	country,
	city, 
	SUM(amount) as total_amount_paid 
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id 
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID 
INNER JOIN payment E ON E.customer_id = A.customer_id 
WHERE city IN ( 'Aurora', 'Tokat', 'Tarsus', 'Atlixco', 'Emeishan', 'Pontianak', 'Shimoga', 'Aparecida de Goinia', 'Zalantun', 'Taguig' ) 
GROUP BY A.customer_id,A.first_name, A.last_name,country,city 
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC 
LIMIT 5
) AS average;
