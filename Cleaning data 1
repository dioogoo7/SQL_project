I used this SQL to chack the film table for dirty data, specifically non-uniform or duplicate data, or missing values: 
SELECT title, 
	   release_year,
	   language_id,
	   rental_duration,
	   rental_rate,
	   count(*)
FROM film
GROUP BY title, 
	   release_year,
		 language_id,
		 rental_duration,
		 rental_rate
HAVING COUNT (*) >1;
