Here is an example of an SQL query containing an inner join:

SELECT B.customer_id, 
	   B.first_name, 
	   B.last_name,
	   D.city,
	   SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Tokat', 'Tarsus', 'Atlixco', 'Emeishan', 'Pontianak', 'Shimoga', 'Aparecida de Goinia', 'Zalantun', 'Taguig')
GROUP BY B.customer_id, D.city
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5;
