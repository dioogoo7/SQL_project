I wrote this SQL query containing a subquery to find out the average amount paid by the top 5 customers.

SELECT AVG (average.total_amount_paid) AS average_amount_paid
FROM (
	SELECT D.customer_id, D.first_name, D.last_name, A.country, B.city, SUM(F.amount) AS total_amount_paid
	FROM country A 
	INNER JOIN city B ON A.country_id = B.country_id
	INNER JOIN address C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
	INNER JOIN customer D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
	INNER JOIN rental E ON D.customer_id = E.customer_id
	INNER JOIN payment F ON E.customer_id = F.customer_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY D.customer_id, D.first_name, D.last_name, A.country, B.city
ORDER BY SUM(F.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5
) AS average;
