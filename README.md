Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world and is now planning to launch an online video rental service. My first task was to load all Rockbusterâ€™s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Afterwards, I used SQL to analyse the data, answer business questions and present the results.

### Key Questions and Objectives
* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
