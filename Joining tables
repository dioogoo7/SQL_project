I wrote this SQL query containing a inner join to find the top 5 customers in the top 10 cities who have paid the highest total amounts to Rockbuster:

SELECT D.customer_id, D.first_name, D.last_name, A.country, B.city, SUM(F.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM country A 
	INNER JOIN city B ON A.country_id = B.country_id
	INNER JOIN address C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
	INNER JOIN customer D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
	INNER JOIN rental E ON D.customer_id = E.customer_id
	INNER JOIN payment F ON E.customer_id = F.customer_id
WHERE city = 'Aurora'
	OR city = 'Atlixco' 
	OR city = 'Xintai' 
	OR city = 'Adoni' 
	OR city = 'Dhule (Dhulia)'
	OR city = 'Kurashiki'
	OR city = 'Pingxiang'
	OR city = 'Sivas'
	OR city = 'Celaya'
	OR city = 'So Leopoldo'
GROUP BY D.customer_id, D.first_name, D.last_name, A.country, B.city, F.amount
ORDER BY SUM(F.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5;
