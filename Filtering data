Here is an example of a SQL query where data is filtered:
SELECT COUNT (film_id) AS Count_of_the_movies, 
   AVG (rental_rate) AS average_movie_rental_rate,
   MAX (rental_duration) AS maximum_rental_duration,
   MIN (rental_duration) AS minimum_rental_duration,
   rating
FROM film
GROUP BY rating, replacement_cost
HAVING replacement_cost < 14.99;
